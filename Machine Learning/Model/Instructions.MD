## Instructions

The train and deploy codes are in their respective .ipynb notebooks. One would preferrably run them on Google Colaboratory with GPU acceleration. The deploy notebook provides an example of how to load a model, to use SAHI's built-in methods to perform streamlined slicing and predicting on the entire 4k image. 

The files folder contain the configuration and architecture YAML files as well as the weights of the trained model. The example image used in deploy.ipynb is also included in this folder.

I must give credit for SAHI, as well as Ultralytics for providing framework as well as notebooks without which the process of training and deploying would be much more difficult and cumbersome.
